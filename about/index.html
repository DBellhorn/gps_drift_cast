        <h1>GPS DriftCast About</h1>
        <div>
            <p>GPS DriftCast was created out of a desire to understand where rockets could potentially land leading up to a launch.  The goal being to help avoid ending up in hazardous areas.  It combines flight characteristics from simulations with wind forecasts to estimate a rocket's final location.  A range of up to 12 hours allows targeting launch times with friendly wind.</p>
            <p>Estimated landing locations are displayed on a static map image.  Additional details can be viewed in <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/about/">Google Earth</a> by downloading KML files.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>GPS DriftCast began as an Excel spreadsheet created by Dave Snyder.  He shared it on <a href="https://www.rocketryforum.com/threads/gps-driftcast-gps-drift-2-0-vastly-improved-landing-location-prediction-based-on-winds-aloft-forecasts.185800/">The Rocketry Forum</a> incorporating additional features suggested by other forum members.</p>
            <p>This website was written by David Bellhorn.  It is a complete re-write attempting to duplicate as much functionality as possible.</p>
